    "**Data 620 - Final Project Proposal\n",
    "Team Members\n",
    "Ali Ahmed, Nilsa Bermudez, Ursula Podosenin**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "Your proposal should describe at a high level what you’re seeking to accomplish, and your motivation for performing this analysis. A guiding question or hypothesis to test is one good way to start. If you are going to work in a small group (encouraged!), you should also list your partners’ names.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should briefly describe your data sources; plan for doing the work, and up-front concerns. If you are working in a group, please describe the roles and responsibilities of each group member. We’ll treat this proposal as a planning document, not a blueprint containing “firm, fixed requirements.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Project\n",
    "Your project should incorporate one or both of the two main themes of this course: network analysis and text processing. You need to show all of your work in a coherent workflow, and in a reproducible format, such as an IPython Notebook or an R Markdown document. If you are building a model or models, explain how you evaluate the “goodness” of the chosen model and parameters.\n",

    "## Proposal for Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "How has election-related misinformation spread through social media networks during the 2020 and 2024 U.S. elections, and what can sentiment analysis reveal about public engagement and discourse around these claims?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how misinformation spreads is critical for improving public trust, informing policy decisions, and designing interventions. By analyzing network dynamics and sentiment around election-related claims, we aim to uncover patterns in how misinformation circulates and evolves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2020 election claims on Twitter: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/voterfraud2020-election-fraud-claims-on-twitter/data\n",
    "- 2024 election sentiment on X (Twitter): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/2024-u-s-election-sentiment-on-x\n",
    "- Additional reference: https://arxiv.org/html/2407.16051v1#S4\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Preparation & Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load, clean, and normalize datas+ets.\n",
    "- Identify and extract key features: user accounts, retweets, replies, hashtags, and claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NLP Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract prominent claims or topics from text using NLP techniques (e.g., topic modeling, keyword extraction).\n",
    "- Conduct sentiment analysis to assess public emotions and attitudes toward different claims.\n",
    "- If feasible, cross-reference claims with fact-checking sources to label possible misinformation (acknowledging this as a challenge).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Network Analysis & Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Construct interaction networks (using NetworkX or Plotly) showing connections among accounts, retweets, and shared content.\n",
    "- Visualize network structures to highlight influential accounts, communities, and pathways of misinformation spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concerns & Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temporal inconsistency (2020 vs. 2024 data) may complicate direct comparison, so we will focus on thematic analysis instead.\n",
    "- Variations in data labeling, formats, and metadata may require additional preprocessing and harmonization.\n",
    "- Limited access to reliable fact-checking data could constrain our ability to formally label misinformation.\n",
    "- Potential class imbalance in misinformation-related labels might affect model evaluation and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- A reproducible workflow (in IPython Notebook or R Markdown) detailing our analysis from raw data to insights.\n",
    "- Visualizations illustrating network structures and misinformation pathways.\n",
    "- Comparative sentiment analysis of election-related discourse in 2020 and 2024.\n",
    "- Insights into key actors and communities involved in misinformation spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team & Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nilsa: Data preparation & initial exploration; co-lead NLP pipeline.\n",
    "- Ursula: Co-lead NLP pipeline; lead network graph creation and visualization.\n",
    "- Ali: Support network analysis; assist with final reporting and synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cleaned and annotated datasets.\n",
    "- Analytical notebooks documenting methods and results.\n",
    "- Final report summarizing findings, with visualizations and interpretative commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to shed light on social media dynamics around U.S. elections, providing a detailed look at misinformation and sentiment trends. Our results could inform future research, platform moderation policies, and public awareness initiatives."
